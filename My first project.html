            <p>Food is the most important basic need for people. A person can live without anything but not food. The
                victims don't have any food for themselvse. So our first plan is to provide them food. </p>

                Shelter for a family
            </h1>
            <p>
                Home or shelter to where we come back from our working place to our family is the second most important
                for
                us. But most of the victims had lost their home in different type of natural calamities. So our second
                plan
                is give them a shelter to stay.

            <h1 class="plan-head">Education for a child</h1>
            <p>
                Education is the backbone of a nation. Children should be educated for advancing a nation. And it is
                need
                for also themselvse.
                That's why our final programme is to provide them education sothat they can be
                self-reliant in future.
